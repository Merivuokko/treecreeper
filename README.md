# Tree Creeper

Tree Creeper (with a package name treecreeper) is a GCCplugin which dumps GCC's Tree data structures together with C preprocessor macro definitions to a JSON format file.

This tool is functional, but alpha quality and not really documented yet.

As of 2017-03-18 I plan to add more documentation and usage instructions in near future.
